## User Experience (UX)

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the company.

     1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with the company logo.
     2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image logo, home page 'What we do text' and bottom title and address of company. 
     3. The user has navbar menu options to choose four different pages to learn more about the organisation.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

     1. The navigation bar and home page clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page and contact details of the company.

### Design

- #### Colour Scheme

  - The two main colours used are Code Insititue light blue, white, black.

- #### Typography

  - The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

- #### Imagery
